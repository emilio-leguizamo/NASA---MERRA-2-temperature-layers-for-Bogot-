# NASA-MERRA-2-temperature-layers-for-Bogota

This R script downloads data from NASA's MERRA-2 global atmospheric reanalysis. 
# Two variable collecitons are downloaded: Air temprature for different pressure levels and Air temperature at surface level.
# The images for these variables colletions are then filterd and aggregated to create a dataset suitable for statistical analysis.

# NOTE: Before running the script, set up your ~/.netrc file as listed here: https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/EL/How+To+Access+Data+With+cURL+And+Wget
